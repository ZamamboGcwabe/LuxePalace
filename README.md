This my first portfolio projet. I am building an e-commerce website full-stack using NEXT.js, REACT.js, MongoDB and tailwind.
Challenge
South Africa faces a significant challenge where local consumers often purchase from international vendors rather than supporting local businesses. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of access to advanced technologies and digital marketing tools for South African vendors, coupled with a general lack of knowledge and skills in website development. Consequently, many small businesses struggle to establish an online presence, limiting their growth and visibility.

To address this problem, our website aims to empower small businesses by providing an accessible platform for them to advertise and sell their products online. In this digital era, where online shopping is becoming increasingly prevalent, it is crucial for local vendors to have a robust online presence. Our platform will offer comprehensive tutorials guiding business owners on how to upload their merchandise and process payments effectively.

This initiative is designed to support local designers, jewellery makers, welders, and other artisans, helping them reach a broader audience. By fostering an environment where South Africans support their local entrepreneurs, we can reduce reliance on external markets and strengthen our local economy.


Risks
The primary concern is the potential for fraudulent activities, where scammers might deceive customers by taking their money without delivering the products. To mitigate this risk, all payments will be held in escrow until the customer confirms receipt of their order by signing a delivery confirmation slip. This ensures that funds are only released to the business owner once the product is successfully delivered. In cases where delivery is not confirmed, the customer will receive a full refund.

Additionally, to prevent customers from misusing the return policy, stringent terms and conditions will be established for returning clothing items. This measure aims to protect vendors from fraudulent returns where customers might use or wear items before returning them. These protocols are designed to safeguard both customers and vendors, ensuring a secure and trustworthy transaction environment.

To avoid having vendors selling fake items, all the vendor items will be ordered and tested by me first before I allow any vendor to start selling any items on the website.
Creating an e-commerce website involves several technical risks, including security breaches, performance issues, downtime, payment gateway failures, user experience problems, compliance challenges, and integration difficulties. To mitigate these risks, it's essential to use HTTPS for secure communication, validate and sanitise inputs to prevent attacks, and implement caching and load balancing for better performance. Regular backups, monitoring, and the use of redundant infrastructure can help minimise downtime and data loss. Integrating multiple payment gateways and employing fraud detection tools ensure reliable and secure payment processing. Additionally, conducting usability testing, maintaining consistent design, ensuring responsive design, and adhering to legal and regulatory requirements are crucial for providing a positive user experience and avoiding legal issues. Robust error handling, thorough testing, and using well-documented APIs can address integration challenges effectively.

=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
